# Contributing to This Project

Thank you for your interest in this project!

## Contribution Policy

**This project is not currently accepting external contributions.** We appreciate your interest and understand this may be disappointing, but we've made the decision to keep development internal at this time.

## Why?

We want to be transparent and set clear expectations upfront rather than having contributors invest time in pull requests that we won't be able to accept. This policy helps us:

- Maintain a focused development direction
- Ensure consistent code quality and architecture
- Manage our limited review and maintenance capacity

## Questions or Feedback?

While we're not accepting code contributions, we still value feedback from the community:

- **Bug Reports**: If you encounter a bug, please open an issue with details about how to reproduce it
- **Feature Requests**: Feel free to open an issue to suggest features or improvements
- **Questions**: For usage questions, please check existing issues or open a new one

## Future Changes

This policy may change in the future. If we decide to open the project to external contributions, we'll update this document and announce it clearly.

Thank you for understanding!
